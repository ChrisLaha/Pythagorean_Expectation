Example of how to use Pythagorean Expectation to predict win% in the NFL

The Pythagorean Expectation
The Pythagorean expectation is an idea devised by the famous baseball analyst, Bill James, but it can in fact be applied to any sport.

In any sports league, teams win games by accumulating a higher total than opponent.

The Pythagorean expectation can be described thus: in any season, the percentage of games won will be proportional to the square of total points scored by the team squared divided by the sum of total points scored by the team squared plus total points conceded by the team squared.

or WPC = TF2 / ( TF2 + TA2 )

Where TF is points scored and TA is points conceded.

This is a concept which can help to explain not only why teams are successful, but also can be used as the basis for predicting results in the future.

We are going to derive the Pythagorean expectation for the 2022 NFL season.
